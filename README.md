# Coffee Quality Analysis using Power BI
## Project Overview:

This project analyzes coffee quality data to identify key factors influencing overall coffee scores. Using Power BI, the dashboard explores relationships between sensory attributes, defects, processing methods, and regions to deliver actionable insights into coffee grading and quality evaluation.

## Objectives:

- Analyze how sensory attributes impact overall coffee quality

- Understand the effect of defects on Total Cup Points

- Compare processing methods and their influence on quality

- Identify regional patterns in coffee quality

- Use correlation analysis to support data-driven conclusions

## Tools & Technologies:

- Power BI
- Star Schema Data Model


## Key Analysis & Insights:

- Aroma shows a strong positive correlation with overall coffee quality scores

- Higher defect counts negatively impact Total Cup Points

- **Washed/Wet and Honey processing methods** consistently deliver higher quality scores

- Certain regions demonstrate higher average quality, highlighting origin influence


## Dashboard Highlights:

- KPI cards for average defects and correlation coefficients

- Trend analysis of Category 1 & Category 2 defects

- Processing method comparison by average quality score

- Geographic visualization of regional coffee quality

- Interactive slicers for date and region-based filtering

## Key Learnings:

Designed an optimized star schema for analytical performance

Improved storytelling through visual titles

Learned how filter context affects statistical interpretation

Enhanced dashboard usability with clean UI and consistent formatting

## Challenges Faced:

Transforming data in clean, consistent format.

Ensuring accurate relationships between fact and dimension tables.


## Outcome:

A professional, interactive Power BI dashboard that clearly explains how sensory attributes, defects, and processing methods influence coffee quality—ready for business use and interview presentation.

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates strong skills in data modeling, DAX, statistical thinking, and dashboard storytelling. The insights generated can help coffee producers, graders, and analysts better understand and improve coffee quality outcomes.
